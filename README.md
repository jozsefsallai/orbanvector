# orbanvector

The only vector class you'll ever need. Has a 10% chance of letting an element
be added into the vector. The others are likely immigrants.

## Usage

Use as you'd normally use a vector:

```cpp
orban::vector my_vector;

for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  my_vector.push_back(i + 1);
}
```
